# Trusted Datasets

This repository contains the datasets used in the paper "Trusted Federated Learning with Secure Aggregation for IoT Networks" submitted to IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering.

## Datasets

The datasets used in the paper are as follows:

1. **MNIST**: The MNIST dataset is a dataset of handwritten digits. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The images are grayscale and have a resolution of 28x28 pixels. The dataset is commonly used for training and testing machine learning models.

2. **CIFAR-10**: The CIFAR-10 dataset is a dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is commonly used for training and testing machine learning models.

3. **CIFAR-100**: The CIFAR-100 dataset is a dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class. The dataset is commonly used for training and testing machine learning models.
