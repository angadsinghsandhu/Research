okay oh my this looks like it sped up a
little bit as far as video playback
!SIL
but the incision was made you tried let's go
in
so first- second grab around the corner
off-camera gosh okay grab number four I
think coming up and then re grab five
and then finished okay so it felt sped
up maybe it was just fast
so yeah
initiation
!SIL
and then the flap is waving which is
good Utratas enter in and slight
oblique angle
egrab closer some basic elastic is
coming out that the chamber is still
stable
!SIL
so the excess material of the
flap is sort of pushed away so that you
can really clear it and grab the flap
edge
!SL
it's trying right at the center sort of
going to the full diameter
I guess the radius then grabbing the
flap and pulling it around
SIL
it's two grabs three off-camera four- some trouble
with four because of the meat of the
flat sort of in the way and then number
five so the fifth grab was very
efficient fourth grab looked like it
needed some- let's watch it one more time
!SIL
pulling
!SIL
and I think that's that's a critical
element to take a moment with the cystotome
and make sure you have a good flap
sometimes trainees will just start and
feel like they've completed that step
even though it may not be finished to
their liking and feel that compelled to
move on to the forceps but taking a
moment with the cystotome to really
create a good flap this is really
helpful to the rest of the case
