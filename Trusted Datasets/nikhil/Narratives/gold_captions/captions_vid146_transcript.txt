!SIL
okay so cystatome is going in it went in
horizontally which is better for the wound
a lot of viscoelastic coming out but this
is definitely a more purposeful movement
it engaged it scratched and then
there's even a little bit of propagation
happening that's sort of a more advanced
technique where you're confident in how
much pressure you're applying the
problem is if you're a novice and you
try that to actually scratch and
propagate the flap
if you dig too deep you can actually
tear through the rhexis so I'm guessing
this is a expert already have done with the rhexis
but you see it's such a
purposeful regrab you're staying in
control and then even at the end they
probably could have finished it but they
just want to stay in control grab the
flap and then really make sure that the
diameter is appropriate
!SIL
okay so maybe- just watch it again
!SIL
so going in so this one wants to come out is
not necessarily bad as long as you're still
in control of what's happening way out here
so it was a very fluid engage and scratch
!SIL
yeah and that's okay that's alright
if you engage a little bit as long as you
still know where the tear is the problem is if you engage the forceps and you have no idea where
the tip was and you keep digging and digging and digging
that's when engagement (inaudible) but if you're still purposeful
who cares if that came out
you're basically- you've moved on past it
very purposeful repositioning in a way that the flap can easily be grabbed in the next step
!SIL
yeah I think so
I mean actually seems a pretty wide
region but the red reflex is so
strong
my suspicion is is that it's using more of the two lights is better than three lights just based on the fact that
we don't have much a radiation of the
speculum and we (inaudible)
and we are a little bit more zoomed in
!SIL
but the thing is that there is pressure
that you put on there so that's something you
want to be careful of but in this case I
think the whole rhexis went so smoothly
when you see the viscoelastic
the problem is that every time you come in and out (inaudible)
!SIL
I mean I think it's important to know that even though this is an expert by no means is it perfect right like when the flap
was right here
!SIL
there were a couple of
attempts to grab it right so in that last
maneuver the decision was made I could
either finish it or I'm gonna regrab
it to be a better control but the
flap wasn't reposited perfectly
as it was for these two or three regrabs so then there was a little bit more
of a struggle I mean it was a fast
rhexis that theoretically if that
flap was reposited it probably was gonna
save another five seconds
!SIL
it's not a big deal but I think it just goes to show
even experts have steps that could be
optimized for them but I think it's
probably- in real time this may be a
decision of is it worth doing that or
can I just manage the next step I think that's probably more of an expert thinking
and that didn't end up effecting what (inaudible)
no I mean do you on want to train the way you approach the flap
because sometimes when you try and
grab it from above and the flap is
leaning in one direction or the other you
want to get on either side of the
flap to really grab it and the
problem sometimes people want to grab it
horizontally and actually grab it in front of it
the problem is when you tear that way
sometimes that slack in the fold
actually creates a (inaudible) jump so that's
why if you grab it from under and over or you know
on either side of you have better
control so that's why your approach sometimes will be (inaudible) but generally
when tearing you can at an angle if you're
maintaining good control of what's happening at the flap
the only thing is they have the flap- they have to tear a little bit horizontally under
