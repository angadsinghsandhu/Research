!SIL
okay so this capsule has been
stained with trypan blue which is great
because you can see there's a very poor
red reflex and so staining it will be
useful- so look at all that viscoelastic
coming out
!SIL
that's a warning sign that
the rhexis is gonna- and I'm just gonna
pause for a moment
so the fact- the fact that so much
viscoelastic came out means that this
surgeon doesn't understand how much
pressure is appropriate for the eye
which is a bad sign because if they push
so much as they start you worry about
how much control they're gonna have
during natural rhexis other issue is you
can see this is the wound right here's
one end and here's the other end and as
they initiate the rhexis they're already
starting all the way at the end of the
loop and that is what we discourage we
encourage that you try and keep your
instrument in the center of the wound at all
times so that you have flexibility and
sort of some excursion wherever you're
working so if you're starting all the
way at the extreme and then you're
trying to make your incision unless
you're a very skilled surgeon who
understands how to make this wound a
fulcrum and you actually move the
instrument as its stuck there as a
fulcrum what's gonna happen is my
suspicion is that this person is going
to scratch and they're gonna try and
drag the scratch but they're only at
full excursion and the whole eyes
probably going to move
!SIL
let's see
!SIL
so more viscoelastic continues to come out
which means they're pushing down instead of using
the wound as a fulcrum and pivoting down
!SIL
and then there's a lot of hesitancy to
make that initial scratch and the
problem is the more sort of small
movements you make- so this person is
actually going from left to right which
is different than many of the rhexes
that we've seen they went from left to right
because of the capsular staining they can
actually see the flap and they're
pulling towards okay and so that's
actually- and they are rotating a little
bit and they came up and so what's
interesting is they're going to pull
towards but what we'll see is the direction-
!SIL
we're going to see the direction of the
flap and how it's affected by the way
that we grab so here it's- what's interesting is- I'll pause it for a moment
the motion of the instrument
going in sort of caused a little bit of a
push and that push of all the
viscoelastic actually caused that flap to
throw backwards so what happened is now
instead of grabbing that flap and bringing it the start which actually looks
pretty good now by that force and the
angle in which the approach was made the
flap actually pushed away and now it's
going to take a little bit more
manipulation to grab that root but the
problem is if you start pinching down to
grab it you'll actually make the capsulorhexis run bigger let's see what they do
!SIL
so if they'll move a little bit more
laterally to try and drag it where it's
still a flap the problem is when you pull
here- this is pulling here you have less
control so now they're going to try and
propagate the tear but mainly what they
did is they just repositioned it so that
they could grab it better so they
came out of the eye- I guess maybe to sort of mentally recalibrate
then here when you want to grab on
either side of the flap but I would have
grabbed a little bit closer because the same thing's going to happen they're gonna pull and
they're going to have minimal control
if they grabbed a little closer
they would have more control and then here they're ending up
at the end of the wound so by being at
the end of the wound now
the tool needs to go this way but they're already
at the full amount and so
it's really suboptimal
because here subincisional is when you can lose
control and they have a really long
flap which is also going to have them lose control so they're regrabbing which is good but they're
grabbing at this point I would have regrabbed closer to where the flap is
because now I mean how much did they actually gain they're still all the way at the end of the
wound and now they're pulling and now
you're sort of in that dangerous spot when you're pulling
you're puling the tear underneath
you can't exactly see where you're
working right is it tearing here is it
tearing here you can see it actually tore
maybe a little bit bigger than I would have liked so now they actually are doing
a little maneuver
they're moving it centripetally in and you can see there's a little
scallop right there that's where we
lost control because it was underneath the
instrument you couldn't see and here it got a little bit small because
they tried to move it in and then because of the view- the staining here the
quality is actually a little bit poor
compared to how well it stayed over here
so they're using viscoelastic to reform the eye and
basically if they can get underneath the
flap will use the viscoelastic to help
create the flap the problem is we know that
the tear ended somewhere over here so there goes the viscoelastic to really help delineate the tip
you can see it stops right about there
!SIL
the problem is why would you put the viscoelastic here
they just flattened their flap again
they did a good job putting the viscoelastic underneath the flap to help
show where the flap edge is then they're putting it past the flap- they've flattened it back down again
and you can see that- you see the angle here is off
!SIL
so they're grabbing it and
!SIL
pulling centrally you can see the tear is there
you can see that it's a little bit- jerking movements which are pretty dangerous
because the problem is with the jerking movements you can actually tear out
what you see here- this is where the flap is too big because they couldn't control
they didn't know where they were tearing underneath the instrument
but now they're trying to make the change a little bit more full
!SIL
and basically by pulling the
they have better control over
the the configuration of the flap so you can see it started
off modestly it actually went along
pretty well but starting at this point
is where the flap is being pulled too far away from its creation and you lost control
so now we're free to grab it but the problem is even if we lift the flap vertically it still sort of
of flat against it means you have to do that grabbing motion to get it but now it means that
they're tearing it even if it's a
patient if they can see exactly where
they will be and that size diameter is pretty good so they're coming around- so hopefully what they're gonna do is as they let go they actually come
bring the flap down a little bit so they create a
vertical face here for the regrab so
they're doing that great and they're gonna come from either side problem is
don't grab there that's still
a little bit far away try to grab there
that's alright they still had somewhat control
maybe they'll regrab
!SIL
(inaudible)
viscoelastic
!SIL
we can tell the fact that we had to inject
viscoelastic so many time indicates the
level of control making the rhexis if an
expert was doing this potentially one round of viscoelastic
filling the chamber which would have
been able to complete the rhexis
because that means that we're not pushing down the wound and having viscoelastic come out and we're in better control
of the- flap as we move it around creating (inaudible) around the incision there it's regrabbed
(inaudible)
going down a little bit to make it a little smaller
!SIL
and then it will connect
!SIL
and then you have some (inaudible)
but it's continuous (inaudible) and you're gonna be okay but here you can see that's really where
we lost control luckily it just barely I think skims the
margin the problem is it was possible when the instrument was being moved past that we couldn't see it
this here we are assuming just went
right there right just barely skirting
the edge of the preparing margin but if
it really was poor control and it was like a
drifting pull it's also possible that this thing could go all the way here
to the equator and then the problem is
if you don't know how far out it goes
when you're doing your manipulations
you might actually end up getting to some (inaudible)
!SIL
yeah basically conservative in trying to use that to help optimize the next maneuver
because if the eye is too soft then it's possible it could have run out like this multiple times
!SIL
I would make the argument that the skill set was lower
it wasn't that they didn't need it and
they did it to be safe
I think they needed it because every time
you saw that viscoelastic coming out
(inaudible) so I think they
were appropriate in that they used the viscoelastic but there wasn't a
sign of a conservative skill (inaudible)
!SIL
the most I think should be right here
!SIL
this to me is to sit temporally or superior
so for me this means that I'm sitting
at the side of the vision or if it's in the
direction of the speculum rotated
ninety degrees then I'd be sitting superior
(inaudible)
!SIL
(inaudible)
!SIL
(inaudible)
I think one specific place was when
subincisionally they have tried to
reposition the flap they did a great
job elevating the flap and then all the sudden
they went past the flap and injected and
flattened the flap so that's where it was- I think- too much
!SIL
too much effort
!SIL
so is it that the (inaudible) was being reduced
no it's the surgeon
yeah so here we can see the flap fell down right
so in order to help lift it I'm saying
inject from below and that will help raise the flap because here it's hard to
tell exactly where the tear is but now
once you inject it you can see that the
tear ends right there so that's perfect
but that's that was the maneuver that
was counter productive alright
!SIL
so you can see
here we're injecting the flap is elevating
we're getting good (inaudible) then I would
stop but all the sudden they go past and they inject
and they flatten it back down
!SIL
and so maybe their thought was now they
can grab it from underneath right here
that's more ergonomic but the problem is
you kind of lose visualization of
where your flap is and I think that was the
problem if you tend to go to grab it and
see what they do instead of pulling- they
try pulling inward
!SIL
but instead it- it
scooped it like jumped up this wa
!SIL
and so that's where they lost control a little bit
!SIL
yeah that's just a little bit of cortical
material has that has built up so this is a
mature cataract we cover the right lens
he felt like money's not necessarily I
!SIL
not necessarily I think if you're (inaudble)
and sometimes you worry- like with a mature cataract that the capsule itself is more
friable you worry that as you pull
say it has less elasticity and it sort of
tears more in another fashion but that
wouldn't correlate to the jumping
!SIL
(inaudible)
no thankfully unless when you make the
incision and you shoved it and
it's a very tenuous ridge then if you
pull too hard you can actually the
rip (inaudible) you created an open (inaudible)
!SIL
but (inaudible) really consistent pressure
but ideally you don't want to be
applying pressure at focal points
especially due to the rhexis
because you already- should stay neutral
!SIL
yes oh yeah without a doubt
the novice surgeon is paying all
attention here and the zero attention here
which is why I often you will be like oh
my gosh how much viscoelastic just
came out and they're like what I don't
know because my attention is here not
here because more is coming out right
!SIL
so that's I think part of the process of becoming a more expert surgeon that you're paying attention to all parts of your instrument
!SIL
but like in this case (inaudible)
because- you're right because more is coming out right now
!SIL
but they just injected and they're evacuating out and putting more pressure on the wound
!SIL
they're recognizing that they (inaudible) into the chamber but then they (inaudible)
!SIL
