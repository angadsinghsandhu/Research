!SIL
pupil is well dilated
that was beautiful entry with the cystatome
see the angle is parallel to the
tunnel of the clear corneal incision
then rotating once it's in the eye there's a little bit
of pressure being applied at the wound
and that's why the viscoelastic's coming
out here the tear- because of the red
reflex it's a little bit difficult to
see the edges of the tear because a
little bit of cortex was also disrupted
but that's a pretty good flap
!SIL
as far as the size it's a little bit on the bigger
size and because the pupil is not super
dilated we could get into trouble if the
size of the rhexis is not well controlled
so here do you see how there's jamming
of the wound
because there wasn't rotation of the Utrata tips
!SIL
so here we're going in but see the angle
it's really hard to grab it 'cause the flap
is this direction and it was like this
and you kind of have to come around and
be able to grab it so we were able to
grab it and now we're entering into that
subincisional quadrant and so here I
would have regrabbed sooner because now
you basically- you can't see where you're
tearing and you have the least amount of
control because this you're so far
removed from where the tear is so now
you're gonna have to replace it and wrap
it and then you're trying to grab it but
the red reflex is a little bit hard for
you to see exactly where you are
and again you're tearing it and do you
see how close we've gotten to the pupil
margin and that's poor control and that
could have happened if we regrabbed it
here instead of regrabbing it here
closer to the end of that quadrant and
now I would have said instead of
continuing that normal flap pulling it
in because now the rhexis edge is just
skirting the edge of the pupil which is a bit challenging
!SIL
but the person is
continuing at the same size of the rhexis
which is pretty big and again now look
at how much the distance there is before
regrabbing the longer the distance the
less control you have on the tear
!SIL
then it finished but if you were to look-
and it's hard because of the red reflex
but we basically started here and then
it just started running out and it
stayed big for the rest of the case and
there's probably a little bit of a slope
to join it to back to the original point
so I'd say that rhexis I would have felt
tense watching that on the side scope
because in the end it ended up being a
continuous curvilinear rhexis but there
were several points where the rhexis
was in in danger of (inaudible) and
that could have been better controlled
if there were compensatory movements to
make the rhexis smaller and if
regrabs had happen sooner so if you want
I can go back through
!SIL
oh yeah 'cause it'll capture the mouse okay
where the running it happened okay- okay great
!SIL
okay so I will stop there for a second
this tear went from here
!SIL
to there and then the flap that was created is right
here so the problem is when you go in
with your cystatome- Utratas to
grab it if the flap is like right there
because of the angle of the forceps
you'd have to tilt a little bit to
really grab it whereas if you tore it
from here down to here and then flapped
it this way then the flap puts it in
such a way when you grab it with the
forceps it's like waiting for you ready
to greet you in the right angle so
that's why I always tell my residents
start a little bit to the right of
center and aim towards your left elbow
and if you do that arc between this
point and to the left of where your left
elbow is then you do it more at the sort
of seven thirty o'clock position instead of the
nine o'clock position a lot of people
feel like nine o'clock is just you need to
go straight across but the problem is
when you create that flap and the flap
sits right there when you go in it's not
sometimes the easiest angle to grab it
so that's- that would be my critique of
how the rhexis started and then the other
thing is because the person tore out to
this point
I always tell residents if you think the
total diameter is gonna be from here to
here tear out at seventy-five percent because what
happens- and you'll see this in the next
step- is when you go in with the Utrata
there's like a little scallop
where it jumps out a little bit as it tears
so if you've already gone a hundred
percent of your arc length and then you
tear it you're gonna gain another twenty
eight percent potentially and you
definitely didn't want it so see here
with the- now the Utratas they're
jamming in because they rotate they're
not rotated ninety degrees to the right and
so you have all this viscoelastic coming
out and that's making the chamber less
stable then you go in- the flap is hard
to see because you've disrupted cortex
and then you- you're grabbing this flap
that's sitting right there
and you have to sort of contort your
instrument to really grab it you're- the
person grabbed it but then do you see
right here- pause it
the rhexis is already so big so it just
it went from there to there and it
didn't need to start off that big but
that's not where it really got out of
control
I'll show you where
!SIL
so here it staring I would have regrabbed at this point or
maybe even two seconds sooner right
because here you've now lost control and
you physically can't even see what
you're doing so you're literally making-
doing this blindly and it's hard to say
I think that's right here- that's where
the flap is that's where you lost- a lot
are we lost it right so now you should
grab it and instead the person is
grabbing and pushing this way the person
should have grabbed it and pulled in
this way to now make the rhexis smaller
so they're basically continuing this
giant rhexis see it right there I mean
that makes me so nervous
and then also the person they put it
down in such a way it's like sitting
vertically so if you want to go and grab
it you're gonna have to do- see all of
this striae a formation because you're
like turning and trying to grab that
flap that's sitting vertically if you
had reposted it so that it- it reached forward then you would have had less issue
!SIL
and then all of
these like clumsy maneuvers just to
regrab the flap unfortunately what you
can do is actually put downward motion
and if you- instead of tearing a flap you
push it down on it you can actually push
and then make the flap propagate out so
that's super dangerous you can't see
what you're doing you're not grabbing it
properly and it's already super big and
so here you may actually see the way
that the force went instead of pushing
this forcep along this axis to tear they
actually pulled it along this axis and
that's what helped bring it down a
little bit so it looks like the edge was
right there but then based on the way
they tore it it now became a little bit
smaller through this angle
!SIL
then that is a beautiful regrab because
then it's ready to go and you can just
grab it with the forceps but again they
grabbed it with the forceps and then
pulled in such a way here there's a
little bit of cortical material in the
lens so it already makes the red reflex
hard to see then you basically stopped
and needed to regrab right over that so
you can barely see what you're doing
!SIL
then here the tear finish step
!SIL
so that was pretty anxiety provoking
!SIL
