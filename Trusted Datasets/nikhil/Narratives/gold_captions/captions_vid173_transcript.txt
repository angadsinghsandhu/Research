okay so here comes the cystatome
attached to a viscoelastic cannula so
they're squeezing a little bit some
viscoelastic's coming out but the tip
was rotated nicely pretty nicely to
enter in and what's interesting is the
scratch it's being made-
!SIL
huh let me just
view- it right rewind it because normally
we make a horizontal slip scratch and
then try and pull the flap but it
actually looks like the person just went
in and is trying to pull it
!SIL
let's see
!SIL
they're entering in
!SIL
they're engaging
capsule and actually going straight for
the pull which is interesting because that makes
a very small diameter flap
!SIL
it's also really hard to see because the light reflex where exactly the flap is
the movement that the tip does seem to be
stirring a fair amount of
the cortical material so I'd say kinda of a rough
start to the rhexis
!SIL
I'm not sure why because there was no movement or anything
the person is just kind of
sort of scratch along and tear it maybe you can see the edge of it right there
!SIL
they're actually- using the viscoelastic that's attached to the cystatome to
help flatten the flap and create more fill we see
so I'm guessing that the flap is right there
!SIL
so the Utrata forceps are going in
!SIL
grabbing that small flap right there
!SIL
looks like that's the border of the rhexis
!SIL
oh- you can see the
arc length is right here which is actually there which is actually not a bad length
!SIL
so here (inaudible) all the way against the wound
which is affecting how much it's spilling out which is also why the eyeball is moving a little bit
!SIL
because they're trying probably to complete the rhexis
here it's tough because they're- it's tearing underneath the shaft of the Utrata forceps
you can't exactly see where it is
!SIL
they're pulling back to help regrab it
!SIL
you can tell by the microscope that there are three lights I would have actually
adjusted the light of the microscope to get more of a red reflex and less of
this peripheral illumination
!SIL
I think that
would have probably helped the (inaudible)
so they're continuing to pull on the flap
seems like it's pretty big
(inaudible)
!SIL
and then they're repositing so that they can regrab and get a bit closer
so that you have more control over the pull
!SIL
and so coming out you can see some viscoelastic
!SIL
well the other ones were easier than this one to see exactly what's happening
!SIL
and now they're injecting
!SIL
now it looks like across the flap
by doing that they flatten the flap down
!SIL
the problem is as the flap comes this way  right
if this is where the flap is and the instrument needs to come in this way it's going to be really hard to get all the
way over here and the approach is from this angle to grab the flap so what happens
is that some people struggle- they come in and they actually try to grab the folded part of the flap
the problem is if you pinch it like that instead of like this you lose control and in the process of pinching you
actually- because most people pinch downward you can actually
get a little increase in diameter
!SIL
I'm curious to see how they're going to go in with their instrument to grab that flap to effectively propagate the tear
!SIL
okay they're bringing it in a little bit sideways look at all that viscoelastic come out
!SIL
they're trying to approach it from the this angle
!SIL
but see by doing that they regrabbed it there it would be better to grab it here
!SIL
the whole eye is rotating because the (inaudible) of the wound
!SIL
and now they're pulling here but tearing here
that means that it's such a long arc length that they're losing control of the flap
!SIL
here they're trying to regrab closer
!SIL
they'll finish it off
!SIL
the problem is when you look at where the flap started it was very messy here because of that cortical material
therefore when finishing the flap it actually makes it harder because of the red reflex
!SIL
so overall it looks like this is the rhexis here
which is a good size
!SIL
but sort of an awkward rhexis from start to finish
!SIL
but unconventional is fine it's effective
but I actually think it made things more
difficult because there's a lot more of
the pulling instead of the purposeful scratching and then pulling
when there's a scratch and pull you can actually create a diameter that you're in control of
because if you pull immediately you just have a small segment
(inaudible)
!SIL
so that one was interesting
!SIL
yeah they kind of poked and pulled
!SIL
which was unusal
!SIL
!S2 was there some continuity in that?
!S1 no not that I can imagine
!SIL
I mean you always want to engage puposefully scratch
and then pull
because if you engage and pull
the tear that you create is going to be of  a very small diameter
and then you're actually- when you spin that around if you're not doing it centripetally (inaudible) the entire rhexis
you're in danger of (inaudible) rhexis that way
!SIL
in this case because of the multiple effects of pulling and making it longer it's creating enough of the flap
then it was almost like the arc length is (inaudible)
!SIL
the problem is if you just engage and scratch and then you took that
!SIL
and turned it around you're going to have a very small rhexis
which is why we want to scratch first and then pull
!SIL
!S2 is that a typical zoom?
!S1 this is zoomed out a little bit usually you zoom just a little bit more
and then again I think the red reflex- you can see the three microscope lights there's this third light
is actually responsible for illuminating all of this whereas you can adjust the ratio of the
two lights and I actually like it with this down to zero and these two lights maximally illuminated
because it allows you better retroillumination and you can see much better
what's interesting is I (inaudible) like I mean I'm
operating either inside the eye or at
the limbus
what do I care about what's going on with
the like lashes but some residents who
actually start with three lights
then they switch to two lights for the rhexis then switch back to three like but
like you just wasted like two minutes adjusting the microscope lights
!SIL
they should be especially because all the (inaudible) like after the rhexis is complete
(inaudible)
yeah I'm not sure what the delay was you
mean between the rhexis being complete and the (inaudible)
!S2 no in between when they were trying to get
!SIL
!S1 yeah something like come out of the
eye look at me
(inaudible)
that's the eyebrow
!SIL
and just by virtue of you have to either sit at the temple or at the forehead
!SIL
so the nose is either going to be away from you
!SIL
or to your left or right
!SIL
yeah I call that the lasso technique where it's just like
!SIL
I think you have to be very confident or very skilled to do that successfully
!SIL
the problem is when you're very confident and not skilled
