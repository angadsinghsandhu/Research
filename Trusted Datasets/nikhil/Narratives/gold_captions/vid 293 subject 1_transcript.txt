okay so the cystotome is going in and
interestingly enough a second
instrument is going in the eye at the same time
okay so I think I kinda understand why
so this is a very mature cataract and so
the concern is is that this might
explode or basically the rhexis might run
out and something called an Argentinian
flag sign which is the capsule stain
blue and a small slit creates a tear
that goes horizontally then you're left
with a band of blue a band of white
which is the cataract in the middle and
the band of blue again like the
Argentinian flag so the idea behind
using this cannula is to decompress or
detour just the lenticular material
that's so fluffy and voluminous that it
could cause tension on the capsule that
you've now violated by initiating your
rhexis so that's why there was a second
instrument that was sort of ready to go
as soon as that small knick was made so
it does look like the capsule is not
exploding or expanding or ripping
through so now the cystotome is used to
create more of a flap obviously the angle
here and so here it just opens up a
little bit more in the pocket and
they're gonna try to suction some more
lens material out before continuing the
capsulorhexis so that's why this is a
long nexus video because it's almost
like the second step of surgery which is
removing the bulk of the lens material
is sort of being incorporated into the
rhexis so now some more viscoelastic is
being put in to stabilize the chamber
there's a high risk of this rhexis
running out really at any point and so
now these intraretinal forces are used in a
more controlled fashion to manipulate
the flap the problem is the angle here
it's really hard to torque and get it to
tear so you can see there was almost
like a little skip that happened there
there might be
fibrous adhesions in the capsule itself
so again some more debulking is
happening
!SIL
so more viscoelastic placement
to stabilize now going in through
perhaps the main wound
!SIL
so again same
problem if the flap was actually a
repositioned so that it was down it'd be
easier to grab see how much laxity there
is between where the flap is tearing and
where the instrument's holding the flap
so hopefully this next regrab will be
more purposeful so again some- I would
have grabbed it as close as possible to
the capsule origin the- the tear the
origin of the tear you can see that the
surgeon is accommodating a little bit
the views getting fuzzy and debulking
!SIL
viscoelastic and here the viscoelastic
is actually pushing the flap but it's
pushing it so that it's going to be away
from the tool so now you have to either
grab it over as it's folded which is a
little suboptimal because the tensions
don't pass as freely
!SIL
okay so re grab there
!SIL
they're trying to
grab it this is where it paused so
!SIL
you're looking at where the edge of the
flap is and so in theory based on that
angle
I guess they're debulking it I would have
gone in through the main incision and
approached the flap so that I would have
a lot of control to grab it right here
and then if I grabbed it right here I
could probably do like two or three
o'clock hours of purposeful tear but by
going in through this wound you're
torquing it a lot because it's kind of
an awkward angle the instrument that
goes here needs to pivot along this
entire arc and it's sort of over locked
here
!SIL
so I guess they're trying to figure
out how to stabilize it because the
problem is the longer you wait- do you
see how naturally it almost looks like
it's tearing out just by waiting and
that's the lens material that's sort of
fluffing over
!SIL
so at 3:27
!SIL
okay so debulking the lens a little bit
I think you can still see that's the
edge that's pretty big as far as your
rhexis size and you can see it's it's not
symmetric it's more displaced their
superior view so this flap really should
be grabbed right about here and I pull
it in to make the diameter a little bit
smaller so another incision was just
made I think to try and debulk the lens
material up there let's see if that's
what happens
!SIL
oh my okay so now we're
going in with the irrigation aspiration
to debulk the lens you can see the flap
is somewhere in here hard to tell
completely okay that's a bit dangerous
so by pulling on the rhexis flap- if you
engage it and actually
!SIL
wow the danger there
is you could actually rip the flap it's
almost like they've grabbed it to be
honest if with that they pulled inward
they might be able to salvage the flap
there are some scissors were used to
remove the flap
!SIL
so now scissorsbeing used to cut
it because I think the concern is that
it radialized outs I mean if it's cut
right there and you can grab the flap
and pull it in and have it join
!SIL
it's
grabbing uh-huh and now pulling back in
!SIL
reposited it but in such a way that it's
not grabbed close to the flap edge
!SIL
and then hopefully regrab one more time and then close it off
!SIL
that
was a tough case I would have done
things a couple of- differently a couple
places so here I would have gone in and
made that small knick and instead of
using this wide flat cannula which looks
even larger than a hydradissection
cannula i would have probably gone in
with an anterior chamber cannula through
the main wound and just entered sub flap
sort of in this central region and just
debulked from over here so you use this
opening but going through this main
wound and basically suck out the lens
material in this corner if I felt that
that did enough to deterjest the lens
then I would have continued the flap a
little bit longer so maybe to about here
!SIL
maybe a little bit more and I actually
would have gone in with the
IA handpiece now and while it's just this
very small opening place the IA
handpiece there and basically suction
out all of this material that was in
this neighborhood so in that small
diameter surrounding this opening once I
suction that out and I knew that the
lens the fluffy lens material had been
debulked then I would have gone in put
some more viscoelastic in the eye and I
would have either gone in through the
main incision using these forceps or
just with the normal Utrata forceps
gone in through the main because here
you could have grabbed the flap so
easily here it's such an awkward angle
and then
you have to pivot this under this is- the
way the paracentesis is that instrument
just naturally wants to go in this
direction and you're asking you to come
all the way over here and then go all
the way over there so it's a fair amount
of tension in the eye so if I felt that
the lens was still very bulky then I
probably would have gone in with IA
again at this point with this much
opening and again debulked and if you do
that once or twice at this point I would
have put more viscoelastic in gone in
through the main wound grabbed it here
because the flap is waiting for me if I
just go in with the instrument to grab
it I could have pulled it through and
just finished it off so I think it was
grabbed a lot to the detriment of the
case because here I think that's why it
ran out I can't see exactly how far it
ran out but that's why we then had to
get the scissors and cut it which means
that even if I ran out here and then we
cut it right about here there's still a
potential weakness in the capsular edge
that could propagate posteriorly during
the case so I think you know another
paracentesis was made here probably
having another paracentesis made down
here would have been helpful with those
intraretinal forceps rather than just
depending on the one that was right at
the three o'clock position but in the
end you know capsule was completed
!SIL
!S4 initially when the started- instead of the first instrument use some other instruments that look like scissor so what is the purpose of that
!S1 when the scissor was used over here?
!S4 yes towards the start
!S1this?
!S4 yes
!S1 oh those are those are microutratas
they have a very
slim shaft and it's just the end that
behaves like a utrata so because it's
through the slim shaft you don't have to
have that wide opening yet you do with
the normal utratas that's why you can do
that through the paracentesis  wound
instead of through the main load because
the main would you'd have to have enough
excursion to open and close it but with
that you can go in through a narrow
orifice and be able to open and close it the
instrument itself has like a long shaft
and then like a bulb up here that allows
you to control what's happening there
!S4 is there a specific reason why in this case we saw it?
!S1 because I think the concern was if they
went in- this instrument know the concern
was if you went in through the main
wound if you push too hard that sudden
depressurization would cause the rhexis
to run out because it's already so tense
and that's under a stable enter to the
chamber that if you decompressed it and
it wanted you to run out just going in
and pushing some viscoelastic out would
be enough to make it run out so in
theory if you're really going to care
about that then I would make the
argument you should make two
paracenteeis and start your cystotome
scratch and then use the micro forceps
all through the parecen- don't make a
main wound yet and then you'll get the
most stability
but having the main wound is helpful
for getting your IA handpiece in there
so
I think if they had another paracentesis
here and then they went in with that
same instrument then they could have
done one arc like movement which follows
the natural trajectory through that
wound here when they go in through this
one it's like locked in this way and
that way because of the way that the
wound is kind of long that's what that
makes it stiff within the cornea
