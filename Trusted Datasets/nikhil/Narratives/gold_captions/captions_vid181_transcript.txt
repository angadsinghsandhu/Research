!SIL
so here's a cataract which is a cortical
type of cataract so you can actually see
the edge of the lens is more cloudy so
typically these times in the outer eyes
have more problems with player because
centrally they actually can see pretty
well but imagine if lights coming- it
kind of scatters light so the cystatome
looks like it went in vertically instead
of horizontally which is a little bit
traumatic to the wound you can see all
this viscoelastic coming out right which
means that the pressure is being applied
to the wound the scratch is interesting
because normally I recommend is going
off center and then making a scratch
like a deliberate scratch across and
then pulling it to create that tear but
the problem is this person is kind of
scratched this way and then scratch this
way so you see it's not actually tearing
it maybe there is a little bit of a tear
there the problem is when you make a
deep pass you stir up that cortex and
it's really hard to see your flap so
here actually whoever it is had a good idea
to stop inject some viscoelastic
move some of that cortical debris away
so you can clearly see exactly where the flap is
!SIL
take this flap and pull it this way
don't go down because then it's going to get very large
if you pull around- there you go
and then you go around and around
!SIL
and you can actually see the edge and then they do a really great job waiting
to reposition it so that they can grab it and keep pulling
!SIL
because here it gets really hard right the instrument is covering the flap
!SIL
the cortical material is leaking over making it harder to see
so this segment right here actually is kind of challenging because you can't exactly see where you are tearing
!SIL
they made it continuous and now they have the visualization again
and so now they're pulling and here's the tear as it propagates
!SIL
and then great job repositioning the flap so that the next touch to regrab it is more optimized
!SIL
but the problem is the person is regrabbing it but they're not regrabbing it super close to the origin of the flap
and so they're having to regrab a lot more
here they grabbed it right there but the argument is if they grabbed it a little closer they would have more control and have to regrab less
so here the problem is as the flap gets longer you lose control
and again they grabbed it here but arguably if they grabbed it here
they arguably could have finished it off in one pull
!SIL
and there- okay they did it
!SIL
the control is definitely impacted by how closely you regrab to the flap when you're trying to propagate the tear
!SIL
yeah it would they could have Trypan stained they could have used blue staining
and then it would be easier to see the difference between the stained and unstained capsule-
or stained capsule and unstained underlying cortex when tearing the fold
so the tear is going underneath that (inaudible)
well it's over it still because the cloudiness is under you can't get the light reflex
so you can't see clearly where it is
!SIL
well I think it's likely fine but you'd have to see but if you know from here to here its twelve
then this is about half of it right
so if I go half and half it's six millimeters (inaudible)
something that I commonly tell the residents is don't try to bleed your rhexis relative to the pupil because everyone dilates differently
so I actually encourage the residents to before they make the rhexis hold calipers at five point five millimeters over the cornea in this axis and this axis ninety degrees apart
so they can visualize what the rhexis
should be and in my fellowship if they
actually had a six millimeter circular ring
where they just lightly the tap on
the cornea
make a little etch on the epithelium it so that way they almost
use that as a guide
for their rhexis there's also such a
tool that's like a stencil
it's made of a silicone rubber and you
can actually toss it in and it literally
sits on the capsule and it's almost like
foolprpoof because imagine that silicone
ring sitting here you
scratch and it'd pull and because
the ring actually has a little
bit of weight to it you kind of are pulling
against the ring and it acts as a bridge
to make the perfect rhexis
!SIL
which is cool but you have to have the expertise to put it in and there's expense to it
and then the argument is that if you use that as a teaching tool like let's say a resident uses that the first
(inaudible) and they get to do it
pretty well then also we're doing it by
themselves they have like no idea how to
save their rhexis because they've never done it
!SIL
so if you define this as twelve o'clock
!SIL
well usually you orient it to the patient so if this is there nose and this is their temple then this would be twelve o'clock
three o'clock six o'clock nine o'clock
!SIL
so for the scratch I would make the argument that they should go from this four o'clock area
maybe this ten o'clock area or maybe eleven this way
!SIL
this way coming from like six to twelve
would be the way to do it
but they almost went from four o'clock to about ten o'clock
this arc
!SIL
it's hard because now they have this flap and they try and grab it
and I think they manage fine and I think it really helps to put the viscoelastic in
!SIL
because it moves things out of the way  and helps visualize it
!SIL
but the thing is when you go in with your forceps if you created the tear let's say I would have done it from here
here to here and then created the tear this way since I created the tear here the fold
could be where the arrow is right and
then if you're go in with these forceps
and you just rotate a little bit
clockwise you could have just grab the flap
but the issue here is when you make the flap a little bit lower angle
!SIL
here watch the forceps going in
!SIL
we want to make sure that we can you
drag it
!SIL
comfortably
!SIL
so maybe I would have rotated the forceps a little bit
more in and gotten a little bit closer to that
that flap like right here
but the bane is if you make the flap at a weird angle
like let's say you made it like right here
and it flapped all the way upwards
where it's leaning away from the wound instead of closer to the wound and if you approach it and it's away from the wound
it's almost impossible to drag and you keep pushing and poking and grabbing
it actually pushes the flap in the other direction
but if your intention is we need to turn
it this direction counterclockwise if
you want to have the flap
fold towards you so that you (inaudible)
if your goal is to go counterclockwise then it makes more sense to have the flap going the other direction
!SIL
(inaudible)
you want to do which way is easiest because you get to control that
!SIL
