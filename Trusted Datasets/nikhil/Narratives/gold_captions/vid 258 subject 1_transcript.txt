so like go through three times okay
recording all right so we see the
introduction of the cystatome through
the main wound it's been rotated 90
degrees to allow for easier entry into
the eye once it enters into the eye it's
rotated with a downward position
there's engaging of the capsule a pretty
short diameter that was cut so started a
little bit right of center and then sort
of was pulled in such a way that it
actually tore to the right instead of
the left is which is the usual direction
when you're trying to meet where the
outside diameter is so and the flap was
not actually created so that it's easy
for the Utratas to grab nonetheless
the microscope as adjusted a little
further and now you can see that the
flap has propagated so there's a little
flap that's been created at the eight
o'clock position and so the Utrata
forceps now go in grab the flap near the
origin tear so subincisionally  regrab
tear again regrab and the flap is
reposited for the next tear and it
looks like the scope is being adjusted
some movement maybe on the patient's
part you try to forceps enter again as
as the instrument moves into the eye its
actually pushing the clock a little bit
because of the viscoelastic that's
inside the eye there's not a good grasp
on the tissue which is why sort of the
fold its not propagated efficiently the
flap as it's regrabbed is grabbing a lot of
excess tissue which is why it's not a
purposeful grab here there are some
bubbles obscuring the view you get a
sense that it's ending and it did end
there so going in again this is- there's
still a little viscoelastic that comes
out which means a little posterior
pressure was applied to the lip of the
wound here this initial scratch is not
very purposeful it's sort of ricochets
off the surface bounces a little bit
it's not clear what the surgeon intended
the diameter to be so usually if we have
an idea of what the diameter of the
rhexis is going to be you imagine
approximately half of that is gonna be
the radius generally I advise to go a
little bit right of center so that you
can go maybe like 1.2 of the radius so a
little bit longer than what the radius
is here the scratch that was made is
very short and again the flap was not
clear so this was extended a little bit
but even in doing that you can see
there's a fair amount of scratching on
the surface and some cortical material
is coming up however there is a clear
edge to where the flap is and so that
allows the surgeon to grab very
carefully close to the edge so those two
grabs were great this however I'm not
sure why there was a pause at this point
but this flap do you see how it goes
actually away from the wound and then
curls up and then comes towards the
wound the issue here is that when you
grab it you'd have to grab it right
there at this superior aspect of the
fold and unfortunately instead of having
that superior approach and landing on
the flap to pull it the surgeon actually
pushes the whole flap- the flap
complex and it all moves away and so
then the grab that's made is kind of
distant to where the tear is emanating
and the problem is that the subsequent
tears are inefficient because you have
all this excess lag of flap that's not
allowing for proper tension so we'll
just look at one more time here so again
it starts in the right place not
purposeful in its contact
!SIL
short if it sort of continued on for another
millimeter or millimeter and a half I
towards the end of where the scratches
the tear was done in the middle and
towards the end of where the scratch is
the tear was done in the middle and
just the left-hand side of the scratch
and I think that's one of the reasons
why there's cortical material that sort
of come up and it obscures the view but
the right decision was made to extend it
a little bit more but to be honest I'm
not clear how smooth the edges because
there was one scratch made this way and
not clear how smooth the edge is because
there was one scratch made this way and
continuous so that was a good grab that
was a good grab
but this this is where I think things
decline a little bit because when you go
but this -this is where I think things
decline a little bit because when you go
in- the surgeon goes in you'll see this
whole flap is going to move away from
the instrument and away from the main
wound
!SIL
see that and then the grab was made more distal where it should be more proximal to where the tear is eminating
so i would try to grab right there there's no way you can grab it right there without repositing it so that the flap is ready for you
and then that maneuver where you sort of grab both
sides of the flap so it pinches the flap
leads to less control of tearing it
!SIL
!S2 there was a zoom before the second time the cystotome went in
how did the zooming make a difference if any
!S1 I don't think it made much of a difference
!SIL
oh yeah here one could argue that there
this zooming in helped sort of the
surgeon understand how wide the rhexis is
being made and allows you to maybe
visualize the flap a little bit easier
now that you're zoomed in so arguably
seeing the flap there is a little bit
easier at this magnification than when
you're zoomed out but I don't think that
that explains why the rhexis
scratch was made so short the zoom
actually should have helped- the fact
that you're zoomed out so you have a
better view of sort of how big the rhexis
is so I think this this is a nice
magnification for doing a rhexis whereas
over here sort of zoomed out a little
bit more but in theory you should be
able to complete a rhexis at this zoom as
well but I think for trainees it's a
little easier at this higher
magnification
!SIL
!S3 that when you said in the last few holes
there's like this excess tissue that is being moved around
!S2 so here see like I would have grabbed it I would
have pulled this a little bit closer
this way and then grabbed it right there
when it's flatter here the part that's
flat is this portion so you could grab
it here but you still have this much
slack so that's a problem right and then
look where they grabbed it like even
more distal to that so this tearing is
very haphazard and then see how they
pinched it so it's like they grabbed it
like this instead of grabbing it like
this
!SIL
!S3 so at this point you've said that they're just taking all this extra tissue
and that just means that you have
less control over your tear because the closer
you are to the origin of the flap the
less tension that's being sort of
transferred so the more accurate you are
and sort of how big or small you want it
once there's all this tissue and you're
trying to pull with this much slack it's
much harder to control whereas if I'm
pulling here that's much more closely
aligned to my efforts
!S3 okay thanks
!SIL
!S1 yeah yeah I mean that's why I say grab
like reposition it first so that is the
maneuvering so that when Yuri grab it
it's ready to go so you'll see in the
like super efficient like four or five
grabs every time you're going to grab
again it's just waiting for you yes and
but if you don't do that you can grab it
pull it back to where it should be let
go and then re grab it and that's what I
would have done in several of those
occasions
!SIL
