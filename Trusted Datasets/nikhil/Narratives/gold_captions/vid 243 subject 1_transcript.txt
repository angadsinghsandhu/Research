I want to rewind it
!SIL
okay and we're recording?
!S2 yeah
!S1 alright the video seems a little shaky
having trouble focusing Utrata
forceps are going in so technically the
cystotome was used already the video
didn't capture that so the utrata
forceps went in without bending the
angle so that's more trauma on the
corneal wound the tear is being
propagated it's being pulled pretty far
from the origin there there was a regrab
and it's not really being torn in a in a
very efficient way it's just sort of
being pulled the view is out of focus so
it's really hard to see exactly where
the flap is and now the scope is recentered
the forceps go back in to grab
the flap it's hard to tell where the
tear is emanating so probably a good
idea to put some more viscoelastic in
the eye and stabilize the chamber
there's a lot of coarse movement going
in and out of the eye video is out of
focus can't see where the rhexis is so
here's the viscoelastic okay so
apparently a new tear was created i guess to
join the flap in the opposite direction
so again cystotome going in and in
the most traumatic way possible which is
vertically oriented the tear is now
being propagated it's hard to tell where
it is there's a lot of cortical material
that's hazy that obscures the light
reflex looks like the flap was
repositioned a little bit things are out
of focus
surgeons probably accommodating a fair
bit more viscoelastic was placed in the
eye to stabilize the chamber some BSS to
help make the view a little bit better
okay so now different instrument these
are inter-retinal scissors are being
introduced to cut the flap where the
original tear was and now
that cut flap the cystotome is being used
again really difficult to see how far
the flap is but it looks like it's being
completed now it's pulled to the center
so basically we can see with this video
there a couple of issues when-
!S3 you have to play again
!S1 play again
so here when the flap is being
propagated we lose sight of where the
margin of the flap is
!SIL
so you can tell
that it was it was torn sort of at this
Center to 10:30 position and then
it's turned around you can see the edge
of it right there as it's passing along
but then here it's being pulled too far
away from where the origin is looks like
maybe it was regrabbed right about there at
the three o'clock position it's really
hard to see so now they're trying to
grab at the origin of the flap but I
can't see where the tear is oh now I
can it looks like it went all the way
here past the pupillary margin which is
too far out so one mechanism would have
been to fill the eye again with some
viscoelastic try to regrab and then
pull centrally which is called the Little
technique but instead the decision was
made to try and initiate the tear at the
other end of where the rexis was
initiated and then that's where they end
up having trouble I think if they put
some more viscoelastic in at this step
things would have been more stable and
this tear would have been sufficient to
basically connect but that actually now
runs out as well so now you have the
tear that's run out here at the 11
o'clock position and the tear that's run
out at the two o'clock position and you
have this almost like semicircle or
moon-shaped
capsular opening and you still have this
rexis from 11 o'clock to 2 o'clock
that's continuous with the posterior
portion of the capsule so that's why the
scissors are used to create a cut that
can then be used to close off that
remaining rhexis
!SIL
and that was effective
so maybe in retrospect could have
started with that or probably use some
viscoelastic so see even that cut is
made and it finally propagates over but
a very hazy view really
is that five minutes?
!S2 one more minute
!S1 really wow
I think that it
does it looks like there was some trypan
staining but the state staining
wasn't really intensely stained and I
think that that would have helped with
the initiation and propagation of the
tear it would have also been helpful to
see how the initiation of the tear was
done with the sister tone but that
wasn't available in the video so here
you can see it looks like the initial
flap is is part of the problem it was
the capsule was in size maybe from the
center to about 10 o'clock and that flap
was left flush on the surface of the of
the lens so when the forceps went in to
grab it it was not a flap that was
pulled up ready to go it was a flap that
had to be picked up and then when you
pick it up at the center and pull up
it's kind of haphazard in how it tears
so if we go back to that step we're
seeing here it's being grabbed more at
the center usually we like to grab where
the flap and the tear actually happens
in this direction and then instead of
regrabbing here
when it was sort of the full flap
diameter and then pulling it just was
pulled in one go and actually it wasn't
really regrabbed properly until right about there
and that's when he lost control
so this flap if the cystotome was made
to purposefully enter in and create a
flap then you would have had more
control as you tear the flap around
because the cystotome made that flap and
that the Utrata forceps were used to
initiate the actual folding of the flap
and tearing there was too much that was
that needed to be done in one movement
if that was broken down I think the flap
would have been under better control and
we wouldn't have lost the grip and have
it run out at the two o'clock position
so I think it's a good example of how
the initial flap creation and way that
it's torn and pulled through the eye can
have repercussions on the rest of the
capsulorhexis formation
!S2 why did the flap run out at 11 o'clock?
!S1 basically if we look back here Oh what
made it run out of eleven o'clock it
when they went in the second time to cut
it with here the cystotome the flap
started right here so they went in with
the cystotome and they did a tear from
here to here basically from like 11
o'clock to 10:30 and then they grabbed
the Utratas and tried to pull it in
that opposite direction but they
couldn't get a good grasp on it because
what they needed to do is sort of move
this whole flap over and they should
have done that with viscoelastic that
movement was trying to push the flap
back down so they can see where the flap
is to grab it better now they're using
viscoelastic after I would have argued
that you needed to put viscoelastic in
before you even tried to make that next
knick and then you would have had more
control of seeing where you are so I
feel like the viscoelastic wasn't used
properly I mean eventually it was used but
if it was used earlier there would have
been more stability
!SIL
!S3 I have one question !S1 yeah
!S3 when you said this was like the most traumatic way to enter what-
!S1 oh yeah because the
Utrata forceps are like this right they
have a pointy down so when you go into
the wound if you go like that you're
brushing against the posterior edge of
the wound so I always tell residents to
go in at a 90 degree angle so you follow
the groove and then once you're inside
the eye then rotate so then it's
minimally traumatic to the corneal wound
when you go in like that you're like
scraping epithelium and scraping the
inside of the wound every time you go in
and out that's a demerit
!S3 and how do you know other than seeing the video is blurry is that the cue for knowing there was some struggle
!S1 yeah I mean that's one reason for the
struggle the surgeons probably
accommodating too much
!S2 what do you mean by that
!S1  so we all have
the ability before the age of 40 that if
we look at something our lens ciliary
body contracts the lens thickens so we
can focus more so what happens is when
we are looking through a microscope our
accommodation should be relaxed as if
we're looking at infinity but through
the microscope but when junior surgeons
get tense and especially because they're
younger than their accommodation is so
strong they start like trying to focus
and as they're trying to strain to focus
the ciliary body contracts and their lens
gets thicker and so they're as if
they're looking at something up close
even though through the microscope and
supposed to be at infinity the problem
is the old attending who no longer has
the ability to accommodate can't
compensate like the surgeon is
compensating so our views like super
blurry chance of a surgeon didn't see it
as that blurry because they just
accommodated through and consoled some
focus at somewhat so that's why we will
tell the resident if that's what we
think is happening is to raise the
microscope because when you pull out of
focus you relax that accommodation and
then the the rule is you should come up
and then slowly come down until it's
just in focus and stop and that's
focusing at infinity but sometimes
residents will go there and then they'll
just keep focusing down further further
and they compensate with their own lens
and then you start getting some like
motion sickness
