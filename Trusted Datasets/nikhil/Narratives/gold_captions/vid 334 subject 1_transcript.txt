all right so cytotome enters the
incision is made really at the center
pull- pulling down this view is zoomed
out a little bit a couple of grasps at
the flap to really make sure that enough
of it is torn so it's easy to regrab
!SIL
fair amount of viscoelastic coming out
of the eye but the chamber is still
relatively stable this rhexis seems to be
a little bit on the bigger side or it
could be small dilation and then regrabbing it multiple times but offering
enough slack so that it's a purposeful
tear and then that didn't have that
maneuver where it was pulled to the
center probably because it was clear
that continuing the tear in its
circumferential direction was enough to
finish it off
!SIL
the utrata forceps weren't really
turned at a 90-degree angle entering
into the eye
!SIL
basically pulled so that it follows its
curvature sort of narrowing the pupil
okay let's look at it one more time and
count how many times it was grabbed
!SIL
so if we didn't do that maneuver to
enlarge it it would have involved more
efforts to grab the flap so here it goes
in and basically grabs it once and it's
ready to go so that's one
!SIL
two
!SIL
three
!SIL
four five and six okay great what's  interesting is I think grab number
three is often the shortest arc and the
last round or the next to last grab is
the longest one
