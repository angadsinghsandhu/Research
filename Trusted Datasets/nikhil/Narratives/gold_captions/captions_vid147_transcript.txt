!S2 one of the video playback so that you- if you want to pause
!S1 okay
!S2 and say something !S1 sure
!S2 about what you are seeing then you can
do that and otherwise you can
!S2 fast-forward it or see click back and forth
!S1 okay is it recording right now
!S2 yes
!S1 oh it is
!S2 you just have to click the play button and be ready
!S1 okay and then-
!S2 - if you pause narration and then-
!S3 yeah so what we have sort of decided is on going
by these three- three questions !S1yeah !S3 what
how and why basically what is being done
how is it being done !S1 yeah !S3 what how and why is
something being done in the way you describe it and so those are
the things we are trying to capture and
so if we see that you are missing out on
those then we'll just give you a
!S1 okay coach me
!S3 prompt saying what how and why
!S1 okay
!S3 so it's a shorthand for that
!S1 okay let's try it and
see how I do
!S3 we will- for this I think five seconds
!S3 or ten seconds- if she's silent for five seconds !S1 oh okay
S!3 then we'll-
!S1 okay so you just want me to talk continuously basically
!SIL
!S3 yeah I mean you would be thinking something so-
!S1 yeah because I need to get milk tomorrow- okay
!S3 alright !S1 alright
!S3 let's go for it
!S1 okay great okay so the cystatome is rotated entering into the wound
it could've been rotated a little bit more to avoid-
there's a central groove happening and
it's a tearing maneuver instead of a
pushing one a couple of extra touches
but the flap is revealed or reflected so
that the you Utratas which are now
being introduced after some irrigation
Utratas can go in also at an angle
and so basically grabbing the flap
allows the tear to continue
so here it's- we're now entering to the
sub incisional tear which is a little
bit more difficult but by grabbing the
flap you can do one continuous tear
through that quadrant and then pushing
the flap so that it's laying down so you can
grab it again right here that allows
minimal manipulation it's better to grab
it closer to the flap so that you don't
have to keep repositing as was done a couple of extra times here and then closing
it out you can just pull centrally that's the end of the rhexis
!SIL
no I think- I think I did it but I'm a little disappointed I didn't do better
!SIL
!S2 in what way
there are a couple of extra touches and
then inserting the instruments usually I
tell the residents to do it at a ninety
degree angle so it's completely smooth
going into them- yeah
!SIL
this is where things would have been better
now just replaying it
!SIL
so I'll just- yeah five minutes
!SIL
so here at 5:07
I would have angled it maybe another like
twenty-five degrees clockwise
!SIL
there's minimal pressure on the wound you can see the
viscoelastic coming out that much is-
is fine a lot of times residents will
push in like all of its gushing out and
then same thing at five minutes and
maybe twenty two seconds
!SIL
coming out maybe
rotating the cystatome a little bit
more so that it doesn't actually catch
the lip again maybe rotating it just
maybe another twenty-five degrees would cause
less pressure on the wound the same
thing going in here with this- Utrata
forceps so now it minute five thirty-four maybe a
little bit more of an angle I mean it
went in smoothly but that's one of the
things I usually tell the residents and
the same thing we can see-
!S3 the angle of the tip
!S1 angle of the tipto the
tip so usually I tell- don't go in like
this definitely don't go in like this- if
you go into that the tip is parallel to
the wound it smoothly enters in and out but I
was guilty of not doing that if this is
me guilty of not doing that which I mean
is minimal disturbance to the wound but
when you're in training every touch adds up
!SIL
so again there I didn't really rotate
it- six minutes and eleven seconds
!SIL
!S2 do you see anything in terms of quadrants
!SIL
other than you know we did sub
incisional first and by doing that we
have pretty good control of the flap and
in fact once we were getting close to-
very close to the sub incision we
actually regrabbed it in such a way that
it was one continuous tear through that
entire quadrant so it necessitated no
regrabbing and that i think is very
important because regrabbing is
difficult and when you regrab in that
specific quadrant there's a lot of striae
that can form in the cornea because
you're angling and the view gets
distorted so if you can grab it really
nicely and I can go back if you want-
!SIL
!S3 what makes you say the grab at subincisional was good in this case
!S1 mainly because it was one grab and then
as one continuous tear until that
quadrant had passed
!S3 do you see anything in terms of where the grab happened?
!S1 no it just it's
how close the grab happened to the flap
so I can show you here
!SIL
so if we define
sub incisional right here let's say that
that's the quadrant so do you see it's
torn and then now it's regrabbed and that
one grab is what's used to pull from all
the way from here to here where my
fingers are actually actually is used to
pull all the way up to there but when we
started from this segment to this
segment it was one grab and then it was
regrabbed so that this entire arc was
continuous and that i think is a sign of
a more skilled surgeon because usually
what happens in the trainees they keep
doing like choppy little grabs or
they'll grab the flap here I can show
you where the flap was grabbed
!SIL
not close
to where the reflection happened
!SIL
so let's count the number of times it
was grabbed
!SIL
and ideally you'd like to do
it as few times as possible and you do
that by grabbing it- so I'll pause it for
a second do you see how I grabbed it
right there if I grabbed it right here
I'd probably get more of an arc out of
it before having to regrab but because
this is the initiation of the flap we
need to sort of grab what's easily
available and because there's just so
little real estate to grab you kind of
grab what's closer to you so I think
that that's fair to do but the result of
it is- I'm gonna pause- now only after
having that much of a tear am I regrabbing
which is not efficient but
appropriate for this first part of the
tear but now see I had grabbed it really
close to the flap where the flap was
emerging from the attached part and now
it's one continuous- so this is just the
second grab
!SIL
and then I'm trying to re-angle
it so I can grab it again but do you see
there I grabbed it a little bit here but
if I grabbed it there then you'd see the
next grab would have happened later
instead of as soon as it happens
because there- that's grab number three
which is not bad- oh this is where I'd
critique so grab number three was
pretty good so I grabbed number four- I'm
about to grab it right there and if I
had reposited so the flap was a little bit more this way and then I could have-
I started grabbing it right there- grabbed
it right there you would see that this
is grab four and the time to grab five
would have been longer so here this is
grab four and then I'm already switching
over to grab five
!SIL
!S3 do you see anything in terms of (inaudible) forces
!S3it's hard to say the
direction of forces because we're
looking more at the tear and the fact
that the tear is happening at this
certain diameter means that the forces
are being used
sort of in an appropriate way if you
look at a more of a trainee video you'll
see if they grab it and they're grabbing
it this way so the force is pulling away
from the rhexis then the rhexis gets
bigger if they were grabbing it too
centrally the rhexis would actually get
smaller
so basically we're using the size of the
rhexis as a surrogate for how the forces
are being applied sort of appropriately
or anymore
and so because the size is appropriate I
wouldn't really say much about the force
other than it's fine
!SIL
so this is now
grab number five I think and then grab
six
!SIL
!S3 (inaudible) chasing with what
!S1 enlarging the flap
!SIL
chases rather than controls the rhexis
so what happens is if- if you pull your
force instead of appropriately outward
what you'll see is it starts running out
and then a resident who knows how to fix
it will then now reflexively pull inward
to get it to pop back in but if you
continue tearing it and it continues to
run out you're not chasing it so if
someone is chasing their flap they don't
know how to appropriately apply the
forces
!SIL
I mean the other issue is if you
were to do a pediatric case even someone
who used this exact same maneuver they
have would have a tendency to chase the
flap because of the elasticity it tends
to want to run out just physiologically
so in those cases you're proactively
pulling in to control the flap the
entire time so you're using a different
set of forces so that you can maintain
that size of rhexis so chasing in
this setting I think it reflects more
that your- you personally are
applying forces in the wrong direction
and you don't know how to compensate not
necessarily that the intrinsic pathology
is causing that to chase
!SIL
and then as far as cortical disruption
you see every time I'm grabbing it I'm
literally just grabbing that flap but
just like fifteen microns
!SIL
if you'll see some
cases the grasp is happening and it's
happening much deeper then all of a
sudden debris from the lens starts
coming up so that's cortical disruption
!SIL
a few awkward or repositioning movements
and the Delic and confidence no cortex disruption
!SIL
