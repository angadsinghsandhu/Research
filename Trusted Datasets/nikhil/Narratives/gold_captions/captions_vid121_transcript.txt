!S1 look at all of his viscoelastic that just
came out
!S2 now I think we are on
!SIL
!S1 press play- there
!SIL
so the wound has been marked
which makes it easier to find the cystatome is going in when the reflex of the
microscope light it makes it a little
hard to see exactly where at the tear is
initiated it was initiated at
the center so I would say that that went
from the central position to probably
the ten o'clock position and then the
flap is created because of the focusing
of the image we can't exactly see where
the flap is but you have a pretty good
idea it's probably right here problem is
it's close to a bubble and then whenever
there's bubbles its really hard to
necessarily get good view as to where you're
working so it looks like they're
grabbing the flap right here but I think the
tear is right about there
!SIL
here are the bubbles
!SIL
can you see it
!SIL
okay so we're going to press play now
so the tear is starting and you can kinda oh-
!SIL
!S1 do we start again
!S2 oh you don't want to move that
!SIL
!S1 so then you grab you pull right about there
!SIL
it looks like its tearing- hard to see the tear
!SIL
and then regrab (inaudible) direction
!SIL
!S2 will- do you want to say something about how to- where the forceps is and get a lot of wrinkles from the corner
!S1 right so basically you
can see the forceps are moving
all the way to the edge of the wound there's
a lot of pushing that's happening on the
wound the fact that you see this light
reflex bend means that there's a lot of
pushing in the z-axis with the forceps
circling up and down on the eye so
generally want to neutralize it as far
as review you can see that the view is
all the way at the top of the screen
which means that the camera is no longer
centered so there may be a fair amount of pushing that's happening
this video quality is I'd say pretty difficult to see
exactly what's going on with the rhexis
we can certainly see how the forceps are
interacting with the wound where its
center- so that's better control
and there seems to be maneuvers to
flatten the side a little bit so that you
can regrab it but here when they're
grabbing it I can't tell where the tear is i can maybe hallucinate that it's here
!SIL
but overall this isn't really good quality
!SIL
and you can see where the rhexis is now if its being finished
!SIL
so overall I'd say it's a pretty hard video to rate
just because we couldn't clearly see rhexis happening in focus when the
person who has it- has pretty good control
but at this point I mean-
!SIL
I don't know
what's happening like did the turn not
finish
!SIL
and it might have been because of
the bubble they couldn't see how the tear connected
!SIL
(inaudible) or viscoelastic
I've never seen this kind of overflow in my life
!SIL
it's like a screw
!SIL
!S2 could you pause it
!S1 yeah
!SIL
!S2 and I assume it won't go back oh they're going back
!S1 yeah so that's why they filled it with viscoelastic
but it looks like the tear is incomplete
!SIL
and so then now it looks like the
flap is finishing and it looks like the
last little tear was right there
!SIL
something is off with the
resolution of this video
!SIL
I don't think it's the angle of the screwdriver
I think the resolution is splitting
or pulling on the image
!SIL
