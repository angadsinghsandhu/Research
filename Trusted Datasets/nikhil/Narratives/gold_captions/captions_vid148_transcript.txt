!SIL
okay so cystatome went in smoothly
well dilated pupil looks like some
capsular staining so a little issue with
the tear but by reconnecting and pushing a
little bit with the- pushing down and pulling
out then there's a nice flap that's
reflected
the diameter I wouldn't want
to go any bigger than that so hopefully as the
tear propagates it stays the same size
so again that's one that's one very
efficient grab that allowed almost five
o'clock hours of continuous tear
!SIL
and then it was regrabbed there but it was
regrabbed a little bit distal to where the
flap was so now it's being having to be
regrabbed again within one clock hour
and then we get like maybe two to
two-and-a-half clock hours out of that
then we grab it nicely and potentially
you could have finish it off but it
seemed like it was getting kind of
bigger so by regrabbing in it allows us to
get better control
you can actually see
here if you look at the edge of the
rhexis this was that pivot point and then
the size came smaller
whereas if we kept
turning it just for the sense of like oh
let's just finish it off it probably
would have run out this big for coming
back in would have been bigger than
necessary so there's no demerit I think
in regrabbing if it allows you to have
better control but you can see one good
grab here allowed us to take continuous
turn all the way until about here it's
almost half the rhexis
!SIL
basically the flap
the tension of the flap was such that it
wasn't tearing efficiently and so it's a
movement where you have to push down to
actually get past that tear and then
pull so that you have the forces that
apply that actually will tear the rhexis
because if you don't engage deep enough
and pull you'll keep losing that edge of
the flap that you're trying to tear
!SIL
so there basically it was grabbed and
right about here we lose it because when
it was initially engaged it wasn't a
huge deep enough so there it got lost
but it wasn't it tore but it wasn't
engaged long enough to actually
propagate to tear and create the FUP now
Aflac is rated because if what happened
with the last case is that the flock was
created but or the care was created but
a flap that was actually elevated wasn't
happening and so that's key because if
you can do this then the next step takes
like one second to just find it grab it
and tear it but if you don't reflect the
flap properly and have it waiting for
you then you go in with your yukatas and
you'll be grabbing it trying to lift it
and I find that trying and some people
will do it they'll make their incision
in such a way like let's say your
forceps are going in here right so what
they might do is with their system
they'll try and tear like right along
this axis and then tear a little bit
this way and even if the flap does a
lift they go in with their instrument
and they can just go in curved a little
bit and just grab it and then copy it
but what I find is with the sister to
him because the the cutting is at an
angle like a 90 degree angle basically
from the shaft of the instrument unless
you went in with the system through your
paracentesis and cut this way right
you'd cut this way and then you'd have
to come out and then come in through
this way and then try and tear it a
little bit it's not efficient so to me
it makes more sense that if you cut
along this axis and create a flap then
you can go in with your recharter and
just take that Club
because you can actually see the
reflective edge and it's there at the
tissue is now darker because you have
two layers on top of each other it
doesn't have to be sitting on top of
each other with it in my mind it needs
to be at least at the 90 degree mark
perpendicular to the surface or now a
bit more of an acute angle away from
where it started
well no I think that it moved pretty
efficiently so I would say that you know
we see some viscoelastic come out having
this velocity card is not bad it just
needs to be done so that there you still
maintain control ideally it would be
minimal amount this Vlasic that come out
because you don't want to be pushing on
the wound but here in this case things
are still in good control
so here it's yeah right there the way
that it was torn it started starting to
go that way here it's being fixed yeah
oh you see at the very end it just kind
of ran out a little bit which is why I
stopped to rear a bit and then pull it
in it looks like the last if this I can
had to do with the way that the
instrument was sort of at the end of the
movement is turned
so here it's fine then we grabbing it
then it's turning yeah it I think it's
just the way that the movement ended the
direction of the pole if at their end of
the direction of the pool had been a
little bit more central than it wouldn't
have sort of tailed out but then we
compensate yeah yeah with this thing
yeah because basically in the next step
we use this hydration saline to just
irrigate and not just like it gets very
gated out there it's flying up now to be
honest even if it like fell under the
iris and hung out and save the entire
case
so
