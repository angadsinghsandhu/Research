okay so this is a- clearly an advanced
mature cataract there's no red reflex so
trypan blue staining was used the cystatome
is entering at a nice angle
so that it's parallel to the tunnel their
corneal incision it's entering in and
then the rhexis is being started a little
bit right of center looks like
fair amount of pressure on the wound all the
viscoelastic coming out you can see that
the capsular staining is great but it's
kind of a soft lens and so there's a
little bit of poor deflection of the
capsule the cystatome is being used to
tear the rhexis and it's not really
tearing well which says that there might
be a fair amount of zonular weakness
associated with suspension of the lens
and so these small choppy movements did
initiate a tear the problem is the flap
reflected back down and the issue here
is if you now want to go in you can use
viscoelastic to help raise the flap but
the angle in which this flap was
initiated- even if you go through the
paracentesis- go through here and try and
lift the flap by injecting underneath
it's still gonna be a little bit
challenging if you have started the
rhexis here and actually came down the
way I normally like to do and then tore it here then you see this- this
that's going in would help basically
lift up the flap but now there's so much
viscoelastic that came out so they're
just injecting viscoelastic to firm up
the eye but the angle makes it almost
impossible to try and reach through the
rear cannula tip to be able to inject
underneath the flap to raise it so now
we're gonna have to go in and you can-
you can tell there's a fair amount of
pressure at the wound this is not being
introduced with the Utrata tip turn and
now it's almost impossible right how can
you grab something that's facing away
from you in that direction if he tore or
she tore it this way then it would have
been perfect but they- created the
flap in the opposite direction so this
is going to be super challenging and
every time the surgeon is going in
they're pushing so much on the wound
more viscoelastic is coming out and
makes the chamber more unstable so now I
would suggest go in back
with the cystatome and see if you can
engage and tear it so that there's
actually a flap waiting for the Utrata
forceps it looks like that's going in
it's going in to where it's it's torn
and then the tip is being turned and I
would pull in this direction towards the
wound but really push down and engage on
it so the person is barely touching it I
think they're nervous and so if you
pivoted at the wound here so that you
use the wound as a fulcrum- engage and
really pull it towards you then you'll
get that flap to tear but it's such a
light touch every time the person is
pulling closer its disengaging from that
flap not doing anything and in the
meantime more viscoelastic is coming up
!SIL
so this is challenging and we can't even
get the rhexis to start
!SIL
so they finally grabbed it and pulled it a little bit so
now what they should do poor thing
so basically it's attached to a cannula
and they accidentally injected a little bit
and an air bubble came out so now it
makes it even harder to see so now we're
injecting more to get the air bubble out
of the way but the proper thing to do
this- this cystatome is- is at an angle
if they had pivoted downwards and
actually engaged right here and pulled
that would have created more of a tear
oh well we have a little bit of a flap
so hopefully they can come and grab it
oh my gosh look at all that viscoelastic
coming out so they're so excited to be
able to grab the flap that they pushed
down and all of that viscoelastic came up
so you can see it's like they barely
grabbed it it's a tiny little grab so I
think someone is trying to use this
cannula to help show the direction of
the movement so the tips really needs to
be going this way right
and so now it's sub incisional you can't
see where you are right is the flap here
is the flap here I don't know
seems to be okay so now they're gonna
regrab it near the flap and continue
pulling keep in mind the chamber is
pretty shallow because of all that
viscoelastic that came out when the
chamber is shallow the flap is more
likely to run out because there's not
enough pressure keeping the flap
controlled and so here the same problem
they- I- the flap was reposted in such a way
facing away from the forceps and at that
angle when that flap is basically
parallel to the nine o'clock
axis it's almost impossible through this
wound to grab it so now we're going to
re-inflate the viscoelastic just to get the
chamber more stable
!SIL
ideally if some of
the viscoelastic went in through this
paracentesis to go underneath the flap
and raise the flap I think it would have
been actually been better if the flap
was reflected all the way back to this
area just so that the ridge of the flap
could easily be grabbed by the Utrata forceps
because they're still trying to grab
something that's away from them which is
very difficult to do there's no edge to
be able to so now they actually have
come around and try to get like the big
meat of the flap to move it forward
which is fine but the problem is
sometimes when you do that- I'll pause here
a second when you come and you try and
grab it from this side and reach forward
when you do that you actually lose
control and if you pull in this
direction this flap actually runs out
because if you've grabbed it from this
angle
reaching for this half of the flap and
then you're trying to tear it you don't
have good control it's always better to
grab from on top of the flap exactly
where it's tearing so let's see if this
flap gets reposted in such a way that it's then easier to grab
properly so then- okay a little bit more
of sort of pulling this flap closer to the
center
!SIL
and then the flap was grabbed in a better angle
!SIL
so now it needs to turn
in this way so I would stop and then
regrab as close as possible there- there-
that was probably the best grab the
entire rhexis and now the way that
they're pulling it's gonna turn out so
that's why I'm- I'm saying come in so
that you can grab that movement and then it's done
!SIL
!S2 first time when you said injecting visco under the flap
!SIL
!S2 why would you want to do that
!S1 because basically if we go back
to where it was it's like a ten minute rhexis
!SIL
let's do it- yeah seven minute- so right there
see how the flap is- it's cut here and
it's torn here but this actual flap
right there is still laying flat so it's
very hard to grab something that's flat
especially if it's an angle away from
you if this tear was right here then
it's easy to just go and grab it right
if instead of the tear being right here
the tear was right here then you could
just go in with your forceps and
approach it undermine it a little bit
grab that flap but here it's impossible
to undermine because the flap is facing
away from you so if we had gone through
here with viscoelastic and injected
right into this space and gotten the
flap to lift up and actually lift up
past ninety degrees even maybe folding over
then when you'd go in with the forceps
you could have grabbed that fold and
started with the rhexis so that's where you can use
viscoelastic to help reposition the flap
so that it's easier to grab
!SIL
!S3 and you said something about the lens property of
being soft so how did you guess that !S1 right so I knew that because when
we were trying to scratch so one the
lens is white so that already tells you
that it's like a hyper mature big fluffy
lens or maybe a big hard lens but it's
definitely a big lens and so when the
initial scratch was made
!SIL
here where you see the scratch being
made
!SIL
one the way that the force is being applied
!SIL
do you see how they're
like little wrinkles that are forming
that's because the lens is soft and then
also if you look right here look at how
this part of the lens is actually moving
if we're creating a flap the amount of
force should not cause this whole lens
to rotate do you see there's a little
bit of rotational movement there so
those lenses held in place by these
spider web-like fibers called zonules
and if causing a little bit of tear here
causes this whole lens to move at the
border that lens it's not very secure
!SIL
which is all the more reason you want to
minimize the manipulations because every
time- like at one point when the person
was mashing on the rhexis trying to be
able to grab it that force is being
propagated to all those zonules and if
they're barely hanging on you can
actually rip through more zonules if you're
pushing down on the lens
!SIL
!S3 so when you said soft you meant more that it's-
!S1 weak- right exactly- like tightly
tethered
!SIL
yeah exactly and so when you lose viscoelastic
it will mimic that and make it seem like
it's unstable but it's the anterior
chamber that's not appropriately filled and
that's why the lens is moving a lot
!SIL
so
even in like the other cases where
things were going smoothly
if the anterior chamber had fifty percent of viscoelastic
that it did during the time of
surgery we be seeing a lot of the similar challenges
!SIL
