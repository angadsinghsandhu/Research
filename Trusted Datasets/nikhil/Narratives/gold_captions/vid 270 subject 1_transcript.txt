!S1 so here we have a really
zoomed in video and it's off-center so
there the surgeon's adjusting so you can
see the scratch is not made purposefully
so instead of having one scratch with a
line it's almost like a wedged pie piece
that is created however the surgeon
corrects it by using the cystatome to
help guide the superior edge
so here the flap is grabbed and then we
pull and you can see the pull is
happening in such a way that it's
tearing at the origin of the flap it's
being re grabbed for the sub
incisional pass and then it's moving
along
then again reposited and re grab there so
turning the corner regrab wrap close to
the edge and then complete it let's
watch that again okay so going in the
scratch it's- it might just be because of
the angle of the eye it looks like it
was kind of being pushed away so maybe
the patient was moving a little bit so
there this sort of recovery of the flap
so instead of having that straight line
and a clean flap that's created because
of the initial pressure and the way in
which the plot was created it was more
of a triangular piece the ctyatome
was used to correct it so now at this
point it almost is like a normal rhexis
as far as how the flap would have gone
so the repositioning happened there is a
little extra tissue that was grabbed but
it was grab- grab close to the origin
there you can see because of the slack
there's a little bit of an angle in
there in the contour of the rhexis so if
you look at it at the end instead of be
completely circle- circular
there's a little bit of a point at that
three o'clock position so again here's
the sort of corrective maneuver and then
enlarging it to the right intended
radius then again the introduction of
the Utrata forceps is sort of out of
view but just it's pulled
then regrab so that it's close even
though there's a little bit of folding
of the tissue because it is so close to
the origin it allows a good grasp and
fairly good tearing so there that's
where you see that little point
let's grab number four and it gets
finished off okay
any other comments
!S2 when initially it's not visible- the eye- you said that it was maybe unfocused that was not done on purpose
!S1 I think the patient may have been moving cause the initial view-
!S2 so is it possible that-
there's two eyes right-
!S1 so I think the surgeon could still see it just the video was
not capturing it centered and that's
often the case that the camera sort of
has a smaller scope of focus so even
though the surgeon is still operating
and you're looking at the monitor
wondering what they're looking at they
can still see and so I think that was
that was an example of it I don't think
the surgeon was blindly starting the
case it's just we as the viewers can't
fully see what exactly they're seeing
!SIL
but generally if they've centered it
what you're seeing is definitely what
they're seeing but if it's off-center
then you should assume what they're
seeing is a little bit different than
what you're seeing
