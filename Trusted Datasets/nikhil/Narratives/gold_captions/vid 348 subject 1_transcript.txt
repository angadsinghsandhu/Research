so here some difficulty of getting
into the eye with the cystotome it
has to do with the way that the angle is
pointing it's pointed up a little bit so
it's catching on the posterior aspect of
the wound and so those multiple attempts
caused enough viscoelastic to come out
this is a- look at all that viscoelastic
coming out because all this pushing is
happening ideally if you dropped the
bottom portion of the cystotome and
angled up and tunneled slightly that
would have allowed you to get in so here
we're using a second instrument to
basically open and gape open the wound
so that the instrument can go in it's
having a lot of trouble getting in but
it made it okay so now we're zoomed out
a fair bit so you can see actually where
the angle of this elbow is and this
basically open-
!SIL
so more viscoelastic coming in through
the paracentesis alright engaging the
capsule so a fair amount of hesitancy so
you can see as it's hesitating there's
more viscoelastic coming out so it
really needs to be an engaged- so very
short stroke that was made it was
actually made to the left of center
which actually gives a shorter diameter
and then the pulling is happening
centrally so you can see it's tearing to
the left and tearing to the right the
problem with that is that when you grab
it depending on how you pull it you
might actually tear both sides of that
flap and not really be able to spiral it
around so the utrata forceps are now
going in again appears to have some
difficulty getting into the eye
!SIL
so some instruction from the BSS cannula
!SIL
so enters into the eye viscoelastic coming
out and again the flap is created in
such a way that it- if the utrata forceps
went in like this and pinched it it
be ready to go instead they went in and
we're hovering vertically on top which
makes it more awkward to grab that was a
pretty good grab that you have to sort
of hang on to it and it was let go
prematurely and so now if that- it just
the surgeon is not engaging the capsule
and remaining engaged to the capsule and
letting go prematurely so there are
short strokes so this is a bit of a
longer stroke and I think it's helping
to mobilize the eye and then the flap
wasn't really reposited so you can see if its not reposited you either
have to come from this awkward
angle which is difficult to do or you
can try repositing it but by seeing
that it wasn't properly reposited the first few microns of
that tear did nothing all I did was just
straighten out the flap it didn't tear
anything and so that's the danger when
you grab it sort of where it's folded
and far away you think you're tearing
but you're doing nothing so it's an
inefficient movement and then you have
all this slack and you can't have a tight
tear as tightly as you think
so here the- all of this is just to
reposit the flap there you go it was
grabbed in a folded way so again the
tension is off a little bit and when you
grab it it's more likely to bump out so
I think some moree viscoelastic is going
in
!SIL
okay now introduction of microutratas thinking that maybe if smaller
wound is used there'll be more stability
of the chamber the problem is the angle
right so you're you're grabbing and
torquing in this direction which is so
far from where the wound is so to be
honest if the flap was reposited so that it laid down in sort of a more normal where it
came from direction then you might have
been able to go in and then grabbing the
underside of it being able to pull but
now these utratas are going in
through the main wound again having
trouble getting in better to rotate on
the side and sort of swivel or shimmy in
!SIL
I think what happened was that it was a
triplanar incision which a Crescent was
used to than a caratome but the
Crescent went too deep so every time the
person is trying to go into the wound
they're actually not entering into the
channel of the wound they're just
getting into the part of the cornea
where the incision was made fair amount
of repositioning
!SIL
or there's an earthquake happening
!SIL
okay so the eye is being fixated the
instrument is still having trouble
getting in the view is a little bit off
we can grab the flap there you go
grabbing it a little closer that gives
you better control
!SIL
then finish it off by playing centrally wait okay that rhexis
is done if we were to just give the
highlights issues with getting into the
eye that was that really hurt the case
because then a lot of viscoelastic kept
coming out and then the key issue is
having trouble regrabbing the flap and not
engaging the flap so I mean half the
video was just trying to get the rhexis
started and then once the flap is made
its let go
prematurely causing you to regrab lots
of times and then each time your
grabbing there's more posterior pressure
which has viscoelastic escape and so you
can see this configuration the flap has
folded over there was a little bit of
correction here but not full if this
flap was brought back a little bit then
it could have been grabbed sort of right
about there instead of right about here
that was inefficient
!SIL
but a round- round rhexis that in
conclusion has a good diameter
!SIL
!S2 what cued you into saying the reason for difficulty was-
!S1 the wound architecture? it was when the instrument is trying to go in the way
that it gets caught
!SIL
see that
!SIL
do you see that little white line there
that's a fold along the posterior corner
because the wound basically was
scratched all the way to this bottom of
the table and then the keratome was used
here but when they're trying to go in
they're going in like this but instead
of passing like this they're going all
the way to this and pushing and that's
why you can see the edge of that point
and so if they basically shimmied
upwards a little bit backed up and
shimmied upwards then they get into
that us which is why the second
instrument was brought in to be like hey
let's use something dull to help open it
so you know you need to go here not here
then you can see if there's still a
little struggle there see you see that
white line
!SIL
