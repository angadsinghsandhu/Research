!SIL
cystatome enters at an angle which is
much safer for the wound
!SIL
the red reflex is a little bit difficult to see because
of the type of cataract you can see that
a scratch is made the scratch itself
can't easily be seen on the video but presumably the surgeon can see it
better and then here with dragging it to
create that flap you can see that
there's some difficulty right here and
the problem is every time the surgeon is
going back to scratch more they're
actually stirring up more cortex and
making the red reflex little harder to
see generally it looks like the diameter
is a little bit bigger than I would have
recommended it's now the edge if it's
really right there is very close to the
pupil area edge the problem is when
you're creating your rhexis if you're too
close to the pupil you can actually
lose control of the rhexis by not being
able to see where it is here you can see
it's just barely close
!SIL
something happened with the video it's skipping a little
!SIL
so you can tell
that here it was torn and it just barely
skimmed the eye- pupil margin
!SIL
which is huge
but luckily they corrected it and
subincisional which is often the hardest
place to pull they redirected the- the
pull so it's a little bit shorter of a
diameter
!SIL
here the issue is they're
pulling but they're also pulling on the
entire eye so you can't see the red
reflex very well and the instrument is
also like sort of at an extreme so now
they're repositioning the microscope because I think they realized how off center they're getting
and so you can see the edge of the flap here waiting for the surgeon to pull it
!SIL
there's so much
pressure being put on the wound that
some of the viscoelastic is coming out and when you shallow the chamber it actually makes it
harder to control the flap so this- this
rhexis is going to run out and you can tell
it's really far and the reason why it's
really far is the eye is soft so honestly
at this point we should have refilled it with some viscoelastic
because they're not very
good control of this rhexis they keep pushing
on the eye
they keep pushing to the extreme
the eye to roll and so you can't actually
see where you're working with the eyes
!SIL
because the eye is sort of rolling up and the patient's
moving a lot so I think that's not helping
so it's not all the surgeons fault but this rhexis is huge
it looks like it's going to end up being maybe (inaudible) of a rhexis
!SIL
which is way too big
!SIL
so now we're gonna redirect the instrument and ideally you'd want to grab that flap
and actually pull centrally
!SIL
so that we can make the diameter smaller
!SIL
so the patient's moving around the rhexis is huge the red reflex is poor because they've had the cataract there wasn't any capsular stainign
that was done which would have been helpful
!SIL
and now you can see they're tearing it and they're just skimming the edge
of the pupil or so you hope
the reality is it could actually be
tearing even further posterior and you wouldn't be ale to tell because you can't
see where the tear is happening
so you're assuming that it's right there at the pupillary margin
but it actually might be very very near the equator or it might be linked with some of the zonules that are pulling forward in the rhexis
!SIL
so now looks like they're going to inject a bit more viscoelastic which could have been done
maybe subincisional but the idea is if you firm the eye then when you're pulling on the capsule
you have better control and it's less likely to run out
so even doing the rhexis in a soft eye  the rhexis will be much larger than intended
if you do it in a firm eye- because the pressure opens up the space
you can see though the
person who's operating is pushing so much
so much all of this viscoelastic just came out
so maybe fifty percent of what
they just rejected just came out that's not helpful
here you can see the tear thankfully
!SIL
and so it's not underneath the iris anymore but if this
movement was instead more down then
we could actually get it smaller and I think they're gonna do that maybe no
!SIL
so they actually instead of pulling it down they pulled it out and ran a little
!SIL
so now they're pulling in finally
!SIL
at what point did you (inaudible)
when they were subincisional
!SIL
like when you started and you could see almost toward this way since that's the edge of it
at that point it's so big that the safest thing you can do in order to make it smaller is and reduce the fluid flowing out
is because the person had to regrab it with their instrument anyway
at that point the viscoelastic has come out refilled the chamber and then grabbed the flap
but instead of pulling just subincisionally they angled inwards a little bit
and that would have made the diameter- instead of as large as it is here
would actually make it stick to being a little bit smaller to there and if you
were there that would have been nice a nice diameter to have held on
then you just pull it subincisionally
!SIL
and then you're still in control and I would have sort of reposited there with the flap and then
injected once more and then continued on this way
!SIL
oh are you saying it's a soft eye your
chamber the way that the rhexis keeps running out in the case that the
chamber is not very full
!SIL
and how did you know that the patient was moving
because at times when the instrument was on the eye still moving around
so sometimes when the eyes like rolling all
the way to the top or towards the nose
or because the bottom is because the surgeon is pushing so hard with the instruments
sometimes when it's just down when you're out of
the eye and you can still see it moving around
!SIL
and if you're trying to operate while the patient's not cooperating
!SIL
did you refer to it as the little technique?
yes there's a surgeon in the U.K. whose name is Brian Little and so
it's the little maneuver where you grab
the flap that you pull inward and basically
like if the flap is going in this direction
but now you pull it all the way centripetally in
it actually creates the tear in this direction so then as you
continue tearing you can actually get a smaller diameter
so it would look a
little bit like a step that it allows
you to reconfigure the diameter
!SIL
having the rhexis so big will effect the stability of the lens but if you had a step
would actually help because that would make the (inaudible)
