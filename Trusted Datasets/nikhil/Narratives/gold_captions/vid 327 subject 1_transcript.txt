alright so cystotome enters nice angle approaches the center you see dimpling a nice
purposeful cut purposeful pull flap is
created nicely cystotome comes out
Utratas will come in next they enter at
a slight angle and then the flap is
grabbed close to where the tear emanates
it's sort of repositioned so that the
flap can propagate and then that
repositioning again and maybe one more
to finish it off then maneuver to pull
in the center to make sure it doesn't
radialize out that was a
nice-nice rhexis so again you know a
couple of options are where you get
started but going a little bit to the
right of center offers you a nice chance
to have contact with the capsule because
it's a relatively short distance that
has to be in size so if you start right
at center there's less incision time or
incision contact so I like starting a
little bit to the right
then there you can see the flap wasn't
fully reposited because it was clear that the edge of the
flap was in a position would be easy to
regrab and that maneuver to follow
radially and then pull centrally to make
sure that it finishes it does lead to a
little bit of a point at the end of the
rhexis which clinically is not
significant
!SIL
so the flap is sort of waiting
!SIL
so this
is grab one
!SIL
reposit a little bit grab two which could have been a little
bit closer
grab three grab four see grab four was
sort of the longest flap with multiple
clock hours
