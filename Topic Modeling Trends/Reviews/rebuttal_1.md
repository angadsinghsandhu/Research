# Rebuttal to Review 1

We sincerely appreciate your thorough review of our research paper and your valuable insights into the existing body of work in this domain.

First, we would like to address your comments and concerns while elaborating on the unique contributions and methodological innovations proposed. While we acknowledge the significance of the paper you referenced, [Topic Lifecycle on Social Networks: Analyzing the Effects of Semantic Continuity and Social Communities](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06161), our work distinguishes itself by introducing several novel methodological advancements that overcome the limitations of existing approaches.

The pipeline in the referenced paper and the proposed methodology are similar; however, the utilization of Word2Vec offers a more *nuanced* analysis of topics over a given time period. While the referenced paper uses **pre-trained word embeddings (i.e. GloVe)** to create clusters by utilizing the similarity between hashtags, it ***fails to utilize embeddings to track*** temporal changes in creating trends (as the GloVe word embeddings **do not** change across time segments). The authors utilize word count as a method of detecting trends, rather than use the embeddings and clustering themselves. In the referenced paper, the authors use counting as a method to track emerging trends; however, we **train a Word2Vec model** for each time slot. This allows for assessing the relationship of base term and relative terms over selected time periods through cosine distance, giving the user a comprehensive analysis of how trends evolve in relation to each other.

> Google has a popular trends tool to show how words/topics are being used by its users, which is the baseline of our study. It only stochastically counts how many times a certain keyword is mentioned, and therefore a single keyword that is being used in *different contexts* can be **easily misinterpreted** when analyzing **multiple topics**. For example, `“race”` in the context of the `“Olympics”` means something very different than `“race”` in the context of `“government”`, but `Google trends` shows the **same** trendline for both of these separate phenomena.
.
> Hence, we propose a **novel** method where instead of individually looking at each term we rather look at it semantically by comparing it with **other words** being used in its context, i.e the **base** word. Therefore, our method has the *capability to uncover trends across varying contexts*. Trends established through the application of embeddings and cosine disatnce along with k-means clustering to the term `"race"`, with `"Olympics"` as the **base term**, ***diverge significantly*** from the trends observed when the term `"race"` is assessed relative to the base term `"government"`. Thus, our methodology differentiates itself from other forms of trend detection.

Our study provides complex data analysis by leveraging **inter-cluster relationships** as well as **intra-cluster relationships**. To demonstrate this, consider a dataset created from a **sports magazine**, temporally divided on each subsequent released issue. Given the base term `“sports”` and the relative terms `”tennis"` and `"hockey”` our methodology would detect **inter-cluster trends** of how tennis and hockey has evolved over the course of time. Similarly, given the base term `“tennis”` and relative terms `“federer"` and `"nadal”` on the same data, the analysis method will reveal **intra-cluster trends** (*how much these athletes are being talked about over time within a subsection of the embedding space i.e.* the **sport of tennis**). The usage of word embeddings is necessary here as we are able to calculate the **absolute difference** between sets of words, given the context in which they appear. For this purpose, we chose to use **Word2Vec**.

In conclusion, while we acknowledge the foundational contribution of the referenced paper, we firmly believe that our research introduces **substantial methodological enhancements** that enhance the *accuracy, granularity, and applicability* of contemporary trend analysis tools. We genuinely appreciate your input, and we are committed to incorporating the referenced paper's insights into our work to ensure a more comprehensive examination of the field. Our “Future Works” section states that the next step to our research is using advanced techniques such as *Transformer-based models* to capture word-level attention to create the embeddings, but **does not** take away from the importance of this study, which will build the ***foundation*** for *more advanced* techniques.
