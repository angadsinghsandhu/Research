# Reubttal to Review 1

We sincerely appreciate your thorough review of our research paper and your valuable insights into the existing body of work in this domain. 

First, we would like to address your comments and concerns while elaborating on the unique contributions and methodological innovations proposed. While we acknowledge the significance of the paper you referenced, "Topic Lifecycle on Social Networks: Analyzing the Effects of Semantic Continuity and Social Communities," our work distinguishes itself by introducing several novel methodological advancements that overcome the limitations of existing approaches.

The pipeline in the referenced paper and the proposed methodology are similar; however, the utilization of Word2Vec offers a more nuanced analysis of topics over a given time period. While the referenced paper uses pre-trained word embeddings (e.g. GloVe) to create clusters by utilizing the similarity between hashtags, it fails to utilize embeddings to track temporal changes in creating trends (as the GloVe word embeddings do not change across time segments). The authors use word count as a method of detecting trends, rather than the embeddings and clustering themselves. In the referenced paper, the authors use counting as a method to track emerging trends, however we train a Word2Vec model for each time slot. This allows for consideration of the context of words in an embedding space, hence directly utilizing cosine distance gives the user a comprehensive metric to assess trends in the given base and relative terms.

Our study provides complicated data analysis by leveraging inter and intra-cluster relationships. To demonstrate this, consider a sports magazine dataset, temporally divided on each subsequent issue. Given the base term “sports” and the relative terms ”tennis and hockey” our methodology would detect inter-cluster trends. Similarly, given the base term “tennis” and relative terms “federer and nadal” on the same data, the analysis method will reveal intra-cluster trends (how terms are changing recursively within a subsection of the embedding space). The usage of word embeddings is necessary here as we are able to calculate the absolute difference between sets of words given the context in which they appear in, and for this purpose we chose to use Word2Vec.

In conclusion, while we acknowledge the foundational contribution of the referenced paper, we firmly believe that our research introduces substantial methodological enhancements that enhance the accuracy, granularity, and applicability of trend analysis. We genuinely appreciate your input, and we are committed to incorporating the referenced paper's insights into our work to ensure a more comprehensive examination of the field. Our “Further Works” section states that the next step to our research is using advanced techniques such as Transformer-based models to capture word-level attention to create the embeddings, but does not take away from the importance of this study that will form the foundation for more advanced techniques.
