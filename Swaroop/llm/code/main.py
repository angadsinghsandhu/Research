## FILE DESCRIPTION
'''
This Python script acts as the entry point for the application, coordinating the processes of training, validation,
and inference based on the ESMnrg model. It parses command-line arguments to determine the mode of operation 
(training, testing, or inference) and calls the appropriate scripts or functions accordingly.

The script facilitates easy switching between different operational modes and handles the basic administrative
tasks like logging and argument parsing.

Usage:
    python main.py --mode <train/test/infer> --config <path_to_config_file>

Requirements:
    - sys: Standard library module for interacting with the command-line.

The script is designed to be flexible and modular, allowing for easy updates and modifications to the training
or inference processes.
